Optimizing Retail Pricing Through Machine Learning 💹🛒

This project showcases how machine learning can enhance retail pricing decisions by analyzing historical sales data, customer behavior, and product performance. The objective is to help retailers make smarter, data-driven pricing choices that improve revenue, boost profit margins, and support dynamic pricing strategies.

The workflow includes essential data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing numerical inputs. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) 📊, the project uncovers trends like demand fluctuations, price sensitivity, and factors that influence customer purchasing decisions.

Three machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

TensorFlow Logistic Regression 🤖

Decision Tree Classifier 🌳

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 📍

Each model was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and log loss, providing a complete picture of predictive performance. Visual insights help illustrate pricing behavior, customer response patterns, and the distribution of predicted price categories.

The final results show that while the Decision Tree delivered perfect accuracy on the test set, the TensorFlow Logistic Regression offered consistent and stable performance—making it suitable for real-world generalization. KNN provided additional comparative value across pricing patterns.

This repository is designed to be clear, organized, and reproducible for data science learners, ML practitioners, and retail analysts. It provides a practical end-to-end demonstration of how machine learning can transform retail pricing strategies using modern predictive analytics.📈
